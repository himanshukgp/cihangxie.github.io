### Workflow
This tutorial is to get you started with git. If you have to use github and git then this is the place to start. Github is where a group of people can easily collaborate their work. Now hereafter I assume you have to contribute to some code already present on github. This is general workflow:
<ul><li>Fork a repository</li><li>clone to local</li><li>work work work</li><li>commit</li><li>push to your remote</li></ul>

### Fork
Signup and create your account on github (Tip: Choose username carefully).
At the top left as shown in picture you can search here for anything. The search result will show everything related to the keyword be it code or repository name or username etc.
