title: Getting started with Git

### Workflow
This tutorial is to get you started with git. If you have to use github and git then this is the place to start. Github is where a group of people can easily collaborate their work. Now hereafter I assume you have to contribute to some code already present on github. This is general workflow:
<ul><li>Fork a repository</li><li>clone to local</li><li>work work work</li><li>commit</li><li>push to your remote</li></ul>

### Fork
Signup and create your account on github (Tip: Choose username carefully).
At the top left as shown in picture you can search here for anything. The search result will show everything related to the keyword be it code or repository name or username etc.<br/>

This is the result I got. On the panel on left you can see the categories code, repository, user etc. I clicked on the first and it took me to its homepage. <br/>![1](/img/2.gif)<br/>From there I forked it by clicking on fork on top right as shown. Before you fork see on how the name is written on top left. It is username/Repositor_name. Go on with fork now.<br/>![1](/img/3.gif)<br/>After you fork it will take you to your own copy of that. Look at the name on top left. <br/>![1](/img/4.gif)<br/> Click on github icon on top left and it will take you to your homepage now. There on the left side you can see your reositories list. Click on the name and it will take you to homepage. Go to homepage now.<br/>![1](/img/5.gif)<br/> Now click on the clone and then copy the link, you will need that link when you clone it.<br/>![1](/img/6.gif)<br/>
 But just keeping the copy on github is not enough. You want to copy it to your computer and work there. So there are commands to do that.
 
 Following are the commands to write on terminal. Install git if you don't have it. On ubuntu do this to install git.
 `sudo apt install git`<br/>
 Following is the general workflow:
 <ul><li>clone on local. `git clone https://github.com/exampletutorialone/game.git`</li><li>make changes (work). Here I simply created a new txt file wrote this "I am learning git."</li><li>Add the changes you want to commit. I named the file my_text.txt. `git add my_text.txt`. At this point you should understand that there are 3 stages. First when you have made changes and saved through your text editor. Now you think the work you did is ok and you can put it to your github repository as well. So the 2nd stage is add it to the staging area. Here you can choose which changes of all the changes you made you want to commit now. Let us say you made changes in 3 files and you want to commit changes in 2 of them. So you do `git add file_1 file_2` where file_1 and file_2 is the name of both those files.</li><li>After this we reach the 3rd stage.Commit those changes. I generally use this `git commit -m "some message"`. The some message that I wrote in end has use that when you will see through list of commits these messages will tell you brief about the changes, so you can write anything in there.</li><li>Push to master. Now push to master by `git push origin master`. Enter the username and password. </li></ul>

<br/> Now got to your github repository to see that the changes are there as well.
